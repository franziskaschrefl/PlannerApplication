# Getting Started

1. Clone the project onto your local machine
2. Open the .sln file with visual studio
3. If prompted install necessary dependencies
4. Download binaries as zip from https://www.enterprisedb.com/download-postgresql-binaries
5. Unzip and Copy their content to the "postgre" folder.
6. You should now have 3 batch-files and a folder named "pgsql" inside the postgre folder.
7. Now you should be able to test the database by running the "start_db.cmd" file (this should later be done by the application)
8. After successfully starting the database, you can import all tables by running the "import_db.cmd" file while the database is running.
9. Now you can run the application after selecting PlannerApplication_pureBlazor as the startup project.
